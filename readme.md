# Foodeys Vagrant

    vagrant up
    vagrant ssh
    cd /downloads && ./download.sh && unzip \*.zip
    mkdir ~/NetBeansProjects
    cd ~/NetBeansProjects
    git clone https://github.com/JUGCologne/Foodeys.git
    exit
    vagrant halt
    vagrant up

Once the VM is back up, log in with vagrant/vagrant, start GlassFish in /downloads, launch NetBeans from /downloads, open the Foodeys project, and try a build.
